# Updater Changes Summary

The updater has been successfully modified to look for ZIP archives instead of EXE files from GitHub releases.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Archive Detection (`src/utils/updater.py`)**
- **Old behavior**: Looked for `.exe` files in GitHub releases
- **New behavior**: Looks for ZIP archives with pattern `Shikimori_Updater_X.X.X_Windows.zip`
- **Implementation**: Modified `check_for_updates()` method to search for ZIP files using the specific naming pattern

### 2. **Added ZIP Extraction Support**
- **New import**: Added `import zipfile` to handle ZIP file operations
- **New method**: `_extract_exe_from_zip()` - extracts the `Shikimori Updater.exe` file from the ZIP archive
- **Process**: 
  1. Downloads ZIP to temp directory
  2. Extracts ZIP contents to temporary extraction folder
  3. Searches for `Shikimori Updater.exe` file
  4. Moves EXE to temp directory with versioned name
  5. Cleans up extraction folder and ZIP file

### 3. **Updated Download Process (`download_update()` method)**
- **Progress tracking**: Now reserves 85% for download, 15% for extraction
- **File naming**: Downloads as `Shikimori_Updater_X.X.X_Windows.zip`
- **Two-step process**: 
  1. Download ZIP archive (0-85% progress)
  2. Extract EXE file (85-100% progress)

### 4. **Enhanced Progress Reporting (`src/gui/update_dialog.py`)**
- **Updated messages**: Changed "Downloading update..." to "Downloading update archive..."
- **New progress states**:
  - 0-85%: "Downloading update archive..."
  - 85-100%: "Extracting update..."
  - 100%: "Installing update..."

### 5. **Error Handling**
- **ZIP validation**: Checks if ZIP file can be opened and extracted
- **EXE detection**: Searches for the specific `Shikimori Updater.exe` filename
- **Cleanup**: Properly removes temporary files even on errors
- **Fallback**: Graceful error handling with detailed logging

## Expected GitHub Release Structure

The updater now expects GitHub releases to contain:
- **ZIP Archive**: `Shikimori_Updater_X.X.X_Windows.zip`
- **Contents**: The ZIP should contain `Shikimori Updater.exe` (can be at any level in the archive)
- **Naming**: The EXE file must be named exactly `Shikimori Updater.exe`

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Consistency**: All versions use the same EXE filename regardless of version
2. **Compression**: ZIP archives are smaller than raw EXE files
3. **Security**: ZIP files are less likely to be flagged by antivirus software
4. **Flexibility**: Can include additional files in the ZIP if needed in the future
5. **Professional**: More standard approach for software distribution

## Backward Compatibility

- The updater will no longer work with releases that only contain EXE files
- All future releases must use the ZIP archive format
- The update process remains the same from the user's perspective

## Testing Notes

- The code has been compiled and syntax-checked
- All error paths include proper logging
- Progress reporting provides clear feedback to users
- File cleanup is handled in all scenarios
